<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumps for Oil & Gas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Pumps for Oil & Gas market comprises two primary types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move fluids, making them ideal for high flow rates and low viscosity applications. In contrast, positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed volume of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, making them suitable for high viscosity and precise flow applications. Both types are vital for efficiently transporting oil and gas across various stages of production and distribution.</p></p>
