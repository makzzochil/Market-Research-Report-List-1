<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graph Database Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>RDF</li><li>Property Graph</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The graph database market comprises two primary types: RDF (Resource Description Framework) and Property Graph. RDF focuses on representing data as triples (subject, predicate, object), emphasizing semantic relationships and interoperability, making it ideal for knowledge graphs and linked data applications. In contrast, Property Graph models data as nodes and edges, allowing for flexible properties on both nodes and relationships, which enables complex queries and better performance for transactional systems. Each type caters to specific use cases and data modeling needs.</p></p>
